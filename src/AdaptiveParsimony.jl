    RunningSearchStatistics

A struct to keep track of various running averages of the search and discovered
equations, for use in adaptive losses and parsimony.

# Fields

- `window_size::Int`: After this many equations are seen, the frequencies are reduced
    by 1, averaged over all complexities, each time a new equation is seen.
- `frequencies::Vector{Float64}`: The number of equations seen at this complexity,
    given by the index.
- `normalized_frequencies::Vector{Float64}`: This is the same as `frequencies`, but
    normalized to sum to 1.0. This is updated once in a while.
