Each operator should be defined for two input scalars,   and one output scalar. All operators need to be defined over the entire   real line (excluding infinity - these are stopped before they are input).   Thus, log should be replaced with log_abs, etc.   For speed, define it so it takes two reals   of the same type as input, and outputs the same type.

Thus, alpha=infinite is the same as no annealing.\nmaxsize=20: Maximum size of equations during the search.\nmaxdepth=nothing: Maximum depth of equations during the search, by default   this is set equal to the maxsize.\nparsimony=0.000100f0: A multiplicative factor for how much complexity is   punished.\nuseFrequency=false: Whether to use a parsimony that adapts to the   relative proportion of equations at each complexity; this will   ensure that there are a balanced number of equations considered   for every complexity.\nfast_cycle=false: Whether to thread over subsamples of equations during   regularized evolution. Slightly improves performance, but is a different   algorithm.\nmigration=true: Whether to migrate equations between processes.\nhofMigration=true: Whether to migrate equations from the hall of fame   to processes.\nfractionReplaced=0.1f0: What fraction of each population to replace with   migrated equations at the end of each cycle.\nfractionReplacedHof=0.1f0: What fraction to replace with hall of fame   equations at the end of each cycle.\nshouldOptimizeConstants=true: Whether to use NelderMead optimization   to periodically optimize constants in equations.\nnrestarts=3: How many different random starting positions to consider   when using NelderMead optimization.\nhofFile=nothing: What file to store equations to, as a backup.\nperturbationFactor=1.000000f0: When mutating a constant, either   multiply or divide by (1+perturbationFactor)^(rand()+1).\nprobNegate=0.01f0: Probability of negating a constant in the equation   when mutating it.\nmutationWeights=[10.000000, 1.000000, 1.000000, 3.000000, 3.000000, 0.010000, 1.000000, 1.000000]:\nannealing=true: Whether to use simulated annealing.\nwarmupMaxsize=0: Whether to slowly increase the max size from 5 up to   maxsize.
